\title{Runs Score}
\usage{
score_runs(object, variable = NULL)

scoreRuns(object, variable = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'explainer' created with function \code{\link[DALEX]{explain}} from the DALEX package.}

\item{variable}{name of model variable to order residuals.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'auditor_score'.
}
\description{
Score based on Runs test statistic. Note that this test is not very strong. It utilizes only signs of the residuals.
The score value is helpful in comparing models. It is worth pointing out that results of tests like p-value makes sense only
when the test assumptions are satisfied. Otherwise test statistic may be considered as a score.

\examples{
dragons <- DALEX::dragons[1:100, ]

# fit a model
model_lm <- lm(life_length ~ ., data = dragons)

# create an explainer
exp_lm <- DALEX::explain(model_lm, data = dragons, y = dragons$life_length)

# caluclate score
score_runs(exp_lm)
