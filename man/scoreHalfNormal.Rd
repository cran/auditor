\usage{
scoreHalfNormal(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{ModelAudit object or fitted model.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments passed to \link[hnp]{hnp}.}
}
\description{
Score is approximately:
\eqn{ \sum{\#[res_i \leq simres_{i,j}] - n } }
with the distinction that each element of sum is also scaled to take values from [0,1].

\eqn{res_i} is a residual for i-th observation, \eqn{simres_{i,j}} is the residual of j-th simulation for i-th observation, and \eqn{n} is the number of simulations for each observation.
Scores are calculated on the basis of simulated data, so they may differ between function calls.
